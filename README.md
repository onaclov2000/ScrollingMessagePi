ScrollingMessagePi
==================

This is to keep tabs on the file "main.c" from the raspberrypi/firmware/opt/vc/src/hello_pi/hello_font/ repo location, I have adjusted it to be a red bar on the bottom, and scrolls left to right from the rightmost side of the screen, eventually adding ability to add dynamic messages as well as overlay on OMXPlayer
